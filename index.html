        then it should go to reject the state and catch the error and print Promise Rejected "

    <h4>
        Answer:A Promise is a special JavaScript object. It produces a value after an asynchronous (aka, async) operation completes successfully, or an error if it does not complete successfully due to time out, network error, and so on.

        Successful call completions are indicated by the resolve function call, and errors are indicated by the reject function cal

        Question 6 Create examples to explain callback hell function
    </h5>
    <h4>
        Answer: The phenomenon which happens when we nest multiple callbacks within a function is called a callback hell.
         The shape of the resulting code structure resembles a pyramid and hence callback hell is also called the “pyramid of the doom”.

        Question 7 Create examples to explain promises function
    </h5>
    <h4>
        Answer:JavaScript is single threaded, meaning that two bits of script cannot run at the same time; they have to run one after another. 
        A Promise is an object that represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation, and its resulting value

        Question 8 Create examples to explain async await function

        Question 9 Create examples to explain promise.all function
    </h5>
    <h4>
        Answer: The Promise.all(iterable) method returns a single Promise that resolves when all of the promises in the iterable argument have resolved or when the iterable argument contains no promises.
         It rejects with the reason of the first promise that rejects.
